#section9.
```{r}
str(file)
```

```{r}
 ## Create a connection to 'foo.txt'

con <- file("foo.txt")
```

```{r}
## Open connection to 'foo.txt' in read-only mode
open(con, "r")
```
```{r}
## Read from the connection
 data <- read.csv(con)

```

```{r}

## Close the connection
close(con)
```

which is the same as
```{r}
data <- read.csv("foo.txt")

```
